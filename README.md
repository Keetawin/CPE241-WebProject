## Evento

The "Evento" ticketing system web app project was created as part of the CPE241 Database System subject. It is a collaborative effort developed by a team of students with the following student IDs: 64070501005, 64070501006, 64070501042, and 64070501087.

The project aims to provide a comprehensive and efficient ticketing system solution for event management. Leveraging the power of modern web technologies, the frontend of the application is built using Next.js, a popular framework for developing server-rendered React applications. The frontend implements a user-friendly interface that allows users to browse events, view event details, select seats, and purchase tickets seamlessly.

On the backend, Node.js is used as the server-side runtime environment, providing a robust foundation for handling API requests, managing data, and executing business logic. TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, is the chosen programming language for both the frontend and backend development, ensuring type safety and improved code maintainability.

PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database management system, is utilized as the project's database solution. It offers features such as data integrity, transaction management, and scalability, making it suitable for storing and retrieving event and ticketing-related data.

The "Evento" ticketing system web app incorporates various features to enhance the user experience and facilitate efficient event management. This includes the ability to create and manage events, configure seating arrangements, set ticket prices and availability, and generate reports for sales and attendance. The application provides both user and administrator interfaces, allowing event organizers to manage events and ticket inventory effectively.

Throughout the development process, the team prioritized considerations such as data security, performance optimization, and user experience. Measures were taken to ensure secure handling of user information during the ticket purchasing process, and optimizations were implemented to provide a smooth and responsive application performance.

The "Evento" ticketing system web app project showcases the team's understanding and application of database system concepts in real-world scenarios. It demonstrates the capabilities of Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL in creating a reliable, scalable, and user-friendly ticketing system solution.
